"""Registry of every sensitive setting in config.yaml.

Two tiers:

USER_VISIBLE_SECRETS - credentials the user types in, copies, or rotates
    via the Settings page. They are encrypted at rest, but the
    `/api/system/settings` serializer decrypts before returning so the
    UI can show / let the user copy them. Examples: provider API keys,
    auth.apikey, compat_endpoint.token (which the user copies into
    Jellyfin OS plugin / VLSub).

USER_VISIBLE_SECRET_LISTS - same tier as above, but the value is a list
    of strings (e.g. translator.gemini_keys), each item handled
    individually.

SYSTEM_SECRETS - cryptographic primitives the user MUST NOT see and the
    backend MUST NOT leak. These are scoped to backend-internal use:
    flask_secret_key for session signing, jwt_secret / file_id_secret
    for compat token signing, the encryption keys themselves. The API
    serializer masks these with `***`.

The boundary matters because the user clarification was explicit:
"we should able to see the compat on the frontend" applies to
compat_endpoint.token (the API token they copy). The compat_endpoint's
internal jwt_secret / file_id_secret are NOT visible - they're signing
keys, never shown to the user.

Membership tests use exact-match dotted paths (e.g. "sonarr.apikey").
The dynaconf API serializer flattens nested settings to that form
before checking, so this stays simple.
